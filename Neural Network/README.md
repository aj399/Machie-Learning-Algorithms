Implemented neural network to predict digits.

Dataset Information
5000 training examples in trainingdata.mat (or training_x.txt & training_y.txt), where each training example is a 20 pixel by 20 pixel grayscale image of the digit. Each pixel is represented by a floating point number indicating the grayscale intensity at that location. The 20 by 20 grid of pixels is “unrolled” into a 400-dimensional vector
